## Features
* ðŸ–¥  **Modern stack technologies** <br>Build modern static websites with bundled scripts and styles.<br>Rapidly prototype and instantly deploy to the server.<br>
Use **any modern frontend stack** (**webpack** bundled) â€“ [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Ember](https://emberjs.org), etc.
* ðŸš€  **Blazing fast and reliable**<br>
Performs nearly 1.000 pages per second (depends on the pages content and raw computer processor power).<br>
 Being online. Server can handle thousands requests per seconds to serve static files (even on tiny VPS).
* ðŸ“¦ **For any hosting**<br>
Doesn't requires **any database** (data stored in flat files) and works on **any hosting** (as it produces *static html and assets files*).
* ðŸšš  **Deploy built in**<br>
[Create a preset](https://cogearjs.org/docs/deploy) and update your site to the server via FTP, SFTP or even `rsync`.
* ðŸ”“ **Secure. No updates needed**<br> 
Just forget about annoying regular update from usual CMS.<br>
It's **100% secure** for hacking because there is no backend after being deployed to the server.
* **Free. Open Sourced**<br>
Use it for free. For any needs. Forever.<br>

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (or any similar project) you can host generated site **for free**.

### What it can be used for:
* Rapid site prototyping, 
* Portfolio site,
* Company site,
* Product site,
* Personal blog,
* Artist or musician site.

Any site that has its administrator generated content.

Using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) or any other _backend_, written in _any lang_ (**PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **Node.JS**) or even with CMS like a **WordPress**, with help of modern frontend technologies like [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org), it can be turned into more dynamic site like **e-commerce**, **products catalog** and so on.

### What it cannot be used for:
* Forum,
* Social network,
* Chat.

Or any other site type with great amount of user-generated content which relies on heavily database usage and dynamically generated pages.
